Description: This package contains functions that I and others have found useful 
    for the analysis of DNA methylation array data (27k, 450k, EPIC). This 
    package is not mean't for a comprehensive processing and analysis, but 
    rather for the sharing of code that is not present in any one of the main
    methylation analysis packages, but should enhance any researcher's  
    methylation analysis pipeline.
