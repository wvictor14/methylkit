Description: This package contains functions that I and others have found useful 
    for the analysis of DNA methylation array data (27k, 450k, EPIC). This 
    package is not mean't for a comprehensive processing and analysis, but 
    rather for the sharing of code that I have found useful for all my DNA 
    methylation analyses.
